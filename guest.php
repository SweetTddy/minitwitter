					<p>Finally made something and hope this sets me apart for others. Below is the basic info:</p>
					<p>
						<ul>							
							<li>Register and don't forget to upload your picture, App looks cute with picture</li>
							<li>Login using email address</li>
							<li>Follow a user</li>
							<li>Home page shows all the tweets whom you have followed including yours</li>
							<li>See statistic about yourself regarding your total tweets, your followers and your following</li>
							<li>See some recommendation like most followed user, user whom no one follows and users who have most tweet</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p><b>To Do:</b></p>
					<p>Wanted to add Re Tweet, Favorite and some boundary level and sanity checks but then thought I might be overdoing with regards to what was asked. Also didn't wanted to upset Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Evan Williams, Biz Stone (wondering who are these, they founded twitter)</p>
					<p>Hope you like it, in case any error pops up then buzz me and I quickly fix it in few minutes.</p>

					<p>I know it's a pain to test an application and that you when it needs to be tested with multiple accounts.</p>
					<p>Who would do the register multiple time?</p>
					<p>Don't worry, I would not burden you.  Have used a Fake Data Generator which is executed once. You can go ahead and run it as many time as you want.</p>
					<p>It creates 10 users and 1 tweets for each user.</p>
					<p>Happy Testing</p>

					<p>Now you must be wondering that Robin saved my time by not making me register multiple times but where are the username and password.</p>
					<p>It's there, just head over to Username & Password section.</p>
					<p>You need to use the email address and password for Logging In</p>
